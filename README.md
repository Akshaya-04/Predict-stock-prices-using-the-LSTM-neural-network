# Predict-stock-prices-using-the-LSTM-neural-network
To build the stock price prediction model, we will use the NSE TATA GLOBAL dataset. This is a dataset of Tata Beverages from Tata Global Beverages Limited, National Stock Exchange of India: Tata Global Dataset.
Machine learning has significant applications in the stock price prediction.
In this machine learning project, I will be talking about predicting the returns on stocks. This is a very complex task and has uncertainties.
